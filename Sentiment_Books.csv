familiar with this story some like myself Although read synopsis generally knew what about still surprised what read just wasn what expected Like didn expect reason Connor died taken aback make view whole premise differently where cringed inside some Evan actions given circumstances added deeper level already very layered storyline which process want into main character none other than Evan Hansen actually greatly appreciated Evan especially spot portrayal some things that struggles with such anxiety this easy character feel something sure plight will resonate with people also suffer from anxiety honestly some best writing that come across regards experiencing those things actually feels from your actions your thoughts feelings When barely catch breath stops water recedes always never drowning doesn matter feeling almost drowning even worse than actually drowning Actually drowning peace Almost drowning pure pain There also another character suffering with mental illness their portrayal just honest Evan This definitely standout aspect about this wasn until writing this review that realised that opening paragraphs this from Connor perspective After skimming over again makes complete sense This split particular order between Evan Connor perspectives know this will indicated finished copy took while figure whose chapter reading Even though Connor story essentially over before began became intrigued about everything that happened until death admittedly craved chapters more than Evan think this because felt more grounded Connor chapters whereas there going Evan which would make anyone second hand anxiety honestly most anxious felt while reading while again just invested couldn this could possibly anything other than disaster want just also that Connor pretty much ghost most chapters reacting events that were happening real time didn mind this would preferred just learning more about Connor past quite sure that ever come across with such bizarre side characters

surprisingly annoying things button with Connor Murphy smiling face Jared reaches into canvas removes identical button selling them five bucks each making money this Connor bring myself didn seem have real personality couldn figure Evan liked much think interesting choice have secondary characters such these when main character actions probably quite marmite already mentioned idea where this story going because Evan really himself into deep hole with lies things quickly spun control times wanted just shake Evan when going tell another mouth forges without mind words arriving they been waiting lifetime spoken part thought being ridiculous also understand that intentions came from good place care people school know care about that ever wanted help Murphy didn agree with actions thought that some things were poor taste know what most part heavily into story whole through mainly what mess Evan himself into next without doubt entertaining read keen ended feel like nothing much happened some
